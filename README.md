  <h3>"Travlr" Web Application</h3>

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->
</div>

<p>
  This class focused on the development of a single web application using the MEAN stack process (MongoDB, express.js framework, Angular frontend framework, and node.js backend server framework). The entire project was designed as a travel website, "Travlr Getaways", and can be found <a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/tree/main/CS-465%20Travlr" target="_blank"> in this folder</a>.
This was a very challenging, very interesting, and very <i>very</i> fun project for me to work on. I enjoy web development more than any other type of project, so this class and application being the culmination of all my learning was just too perfect.
</p>

<p>To get a better idea of what this whole project was about, check out the <a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/module-6/writeups/Project%20Guidelines%20and%20Rubric.pdf" target="_blank"> Guidelines and Rubric document</a>.

This project went through several design changes as it was developed, but the wireframe was the main guide to get to the finished product. The <a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/main/writeups/Software%20Design%20Document%20-Module%207%20-%20Artl.docx.pdf" target="_blank"> final design document</a> summarizes the entire project, including routes and testing.</p>

<!-- DEVLOPMENT OF THE PROJECT -->
### How I Developed The Project

  <p>
While the above project had a guide to follow during development, the guide was far from perfect, and there were many instances where refactoring was a necessity. Some of the installed component's versions are newer than what the original code was written for, and thus some changes needed to be made to get routes and other parts to work properly. With Javascript not being my primary language, there was also a bit of a steep learning curve at first. However, problem-solving is my forte, and I view debugging as not so much a tedium but a fun exploration of the code. Therefore making the project work was a very enjoyable learning experience.
</p>
<p>
My approach to solving the above problem (and all others in any other aspect of my life) is methodical and logical. I typically know the limitations and abilites of the tools I am using to solve the problem, and using a one-step-at-a-time method helps me to work efficiently. I rarely have the problem in missing the "forest for the trees"; in fact, I'm very good at stepping back from the details and seeing the big picture for what it is, and then stepping back into the details with an understanding of how they effect the overall problem / solution.

  ```

### Installation

To install and run the application, follow the instructions below.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   gh repo clone lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development-I
   ```
2. Open the folder in VS Code
3. Navigate to the "app_admin" folder
   ```sh
   cd app_admin
   ```  
4. Install NPM packages
   ```sh

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<h3>Front-end Customer Facing Website</h3>
<p>The main customer page uses standard HTML with javascript and handlebars to access the backend database (served by MongoDB local hosting) and display available information to customers. </p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Homepage</th>
        <th>Travel Page</th>    
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/main/images/user_facing_page.png" alt="[main user page]" style="width=auto;"></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/main/images/travel_page_user.png" alt="[travel page]" style="width=auto;"></td>
    </tr>
        
</table>

<h3>Backend SPA (using Angular, Express, node.js, and MongoDB)</h3>
<p>The project incorporated a administrative backend that utilized the Angular, Express, node.js, and MongoDB (MEAN) stack system to deliver a single-page application to administrators. In this SPA a user could log-in, Add trips, Edit trips, and Delete trips. All changes made in the backend were instantly visible on the front end page for customers.</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Homepage</th>
        <th>Login Screen</th>
        <th>Logged In</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/main/images/user_logged_out.png" alt="[homepage]" style="width=auto;"></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/main/images/login_page.png" alt="[login]" style="width=auto;"></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/main/images/main_page.png" alt="[logged in]" style="width=auto;"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Editing a Trip</th>
        <th>Trip Succesfully Edited</th>
        <th>Trip Deleted</th
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/main/images/editing_trip.png" alt="[edit]" style="width=auto;"></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/main/images/trip_edited_successfully.png" alt="[success]" style="width=auto;"></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_465_Full-Stack-Development/blob/main/images/trip_deleted_successfully.png" alt="[deleted]" style="width=auto;"></td>
    </tr>
</table>
